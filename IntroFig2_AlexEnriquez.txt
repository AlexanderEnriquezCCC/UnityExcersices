You had said to put Jefro's (I think that is his name) math into a txt doc.
This I believe for some deck of cards calculation of how likely it was to draw two aces (in a deck of 52 cards w/ 4 aces) in a row.
The math is [(4/52)*(3/51)], due to taking one card out you subtract one from the denominator and numerator since we are searching for the same numerical card.
